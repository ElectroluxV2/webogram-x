### Usage
To use this style, you need a browser plugin such as [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/). It injects custom CSS code into specified webpages.

Just copy & paste the content of the [webogram-x.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-Rickyy-b/webogram-x/master/webogram-x.css) (or the minified version) into the plugin you are using.

### Auto-Update CSS
You are sick of manually updating the CSS after changes have been made or issues have been fixed? Just add a new style to your stylus plugin with the following content:

```@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-Rickyy-b/webogram-x/master/webogram-x.css)```

When loading the style, your browser will load the current css from this repository.

### Found an issue
If you think you found an issue with the style (and I bet there are plenty), go ahead and open an issue in the GitHub issue tracker.
Thanks for your support.
